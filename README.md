The ID Management solution E-PIX (Enterprise Identifier Cross Referencing) applies the Fellegi-Sunter-algorithm and the Levenshtein distance to avoid duplicate participant entries. The independent software module facilitates participant management and multisite-aggregation of medical research data. Additionally, the correction of potential synonym errors is supported (i.e. false-negative record linkage).
